## WhatsApp Automation Bot
This project automates sending WhatsApp messages via the desktop app using Python's pyautogui and other utilities. It reads contact numbers and messages from an Excel file, sends messages to each contact, and records the status back to the file.


## Overview
The WhatsApp Automation Bot is designed to streamline the process of sending bulk messages via WhatsApp. It reads an Excel file containing phone numbers, opens the WhatsApp desktop application, searches for each contact, sends a message, and updates the Excel file with the delivery status. This is especially useful for business messaging, notifications, and reminders.

## Features

Excel Integration: Reads contacts from and writes message statuses to an Excel file.
Error Handling: Records "Failed to send" status if a message cannot be delivered.
